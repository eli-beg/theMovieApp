# MovieApp (WIP) ðŸš€

A simple project created using ReactJS to show the use of a REST Api

# It Contains:

- A navigation bar that allows you to navigate through different sections
- A search bar that allows you to find any movie, tv show or person
- The details of any movie or tv show
- Carrousels that show you the top rated movies or upcoming movies
- A footer that allows you to navigate through different sections

# Technologies:

-ReactJs
-Material UI

All movies information came from The Movie Database website (https://www.themoviedb.org/). They have this amazing API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) that could be used by any one.
